# Testing (not forum)

Let's try to write clean tests for the general structure of the application (routing, ...). Basically everything except the "forum" features/services.

Note that that may require to re-enable the `serverless-dynamodb-local` in `./serverless.yml` (it may left for when we will do the forum tests).
